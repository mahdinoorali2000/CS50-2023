                <h2>Computer Vision Challenge :</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Perhaps because of this, computer vision seemed so simple that humans could do it without much effort. Despite the simple idea of the problem of machine vision, creating the ability to see for computers turned out to be a very difficult task and a big challenge for experts in the field of artificial intelligence.
                    <br><br>
                    The goal of computer vision is to extract useful information from photos, which has been surprisingly difficult. In the past four decades, this goal has occupied the minds of thousands of smart and creative engineers and specialists in this field, but despite this, humans are still far from building an efficient machine with the ability to see and understand images.
                    <br><br>
                    Computer vision was initially thought to be a simple problem that could be solved by a student by connecting a camera to a computer. After decades of research, computer vision remains an unsolved problem, at least compared to human vision.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 1960s, the ability to see a computer was something artificial intelligence experts expected to be as difficult as a student summer project. But after forty years, the issue has not been resolved and it seems difficult.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the reasons for this is that despite the development of medical sciences in the field of vision and neurology, we still do not have enough information about the function and mechanism of vision and its analysis in the human brain, and like any other research in the field of brain and Nerves, there is a long way to understand this.
                    <br><br>
                    Perceptual psychologists have spent decades trying to understand how the visual system works, but despite their remarkable achievements, the complete solution to this puzzle remains elusive.
                    <br><br>
                    Another reason that has made this issue more challenging; Complexity is inherent in the visual world. Imagine an object. It can be seen from any direction, in any lighting conditions, with all kinds of overlaps from other objects. A real vision system like the human eye must be able to see in countless situations and extract meaningful content.
                    <br><br>
                    It is in the conditions that computers perform well in complex but limited problems and do not perform optimally in open and unbounded problems such as vision perception, which is considered the biggest challenge of machine vision.
