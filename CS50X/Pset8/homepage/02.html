                <h2>What is the purpose of computer vision ?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>At an abstract level, the goal of computer vision is to use image data to infer something about the world.
                        <br><br>
                    Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field that is generally considered a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning that may use its own methods and general learning algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a multidisciplinary field, this field may seem a bit disorganized because it uses techniques; which is used in heterogeneous areas of engineering and computer science.
                    <br><br>
                    Some vision problems and information may be solved by manual and simple statistical methods, while complex machine learning algorithms may be used to solve other problems.
                    <br><br>
                    Machine vision as a field is exciting, crowded, and messy at the forefront of science, and there is usually no reliable expert on it. Many useful ideas have no theoretical basis, and some ideas are useless in practice. Its developed parts are widely scattered, and most of these parts do not have significant interaction and communication with each other.
                    <br><br>
                    The goal of computer vision is to understand the content of visual data, which obviously requires the development of models and methods for vision as well as simulation of human vision. Understanding the content of image data includes descriptive extraction.
                    <br><br>
                    Images can contain various information that are automatically extracted in computer vision. The information in the images can be in the form of 3D models, camera position, object recognition and grouping and search for photo content.
