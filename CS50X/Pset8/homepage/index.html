                    Today we are inundated with images. Smartphones have cameras, and taking and sharing photos and videos has never been easier. This issue has led to the incredible growth of modern social networks such as Twitter, Instagram, etc.

                <p>
                    Every day we use the YouTube search engine, where hundreds of hours of videos are uploaded every minute and billions of videos are watched daily.

                    A large part of the internet consists of text and images. Searching for texts on the Internet has become relatively easy thanks to search engines like Google. But the basic challenge of large and widely used search engines is to search for images on the web.

                <p>
                    In order to have a proper performance in image search algorithms, it is necessary for these algorithms to understand the content of existing images. Until now, the content of photos and videos that were uploaded on the Internet; It was vague and the best way to explain them was the descriptions of the people who uploaded it.

                <p>
                    To make optimal use of image data, we need computers to see the image and understand its content. This is an obvious and relatively simple issue for humans, even a young child.
